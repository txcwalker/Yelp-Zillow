## Abstract
This project explores the relationship between local business activity and housing prices by combining **Yelp API business data** with **Zillow housing data**. The primary objectives were:

- To test whether Yelp business metrics can help predict housing prices.
- To build a **random forest regression model** that uses Yelp data as features.
- To reverse-engineer and compare Yelpâ€™s **search functionality** against an engineered search algorithm.

This project shows how public business data can be applied to real estate analytics while also highlighting potential biases in search algorithms.

## Features

- **Yelp Data Integration**: Extracted and aggregated business data from Yelpâ€™s API.  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Built a random forest regression model to estimate housing prices and mapped results for evaluation.  
- **Search Algorithm Analysis**: Designed and tested a custom search algorithm against Yelpâ€™s version to explore bias.  
- **Visualization**: Created heat density maps and tag graphs to summarize and display geographic patterns.

## Results
- The **random forest model** demonstrated promising predictive ability for housing price estimation.  
- The **search bias analysis** revealed measurable differences between the engineered and Yelp algorithms.  
- Visual outputs (heat maps, graphs) revealed clear spatial patterns in business activity and housing prices.

## Future Work
- Test alternative machine learning models (e.g., gradient boosting, XGBoost).  
- Expand coverage to additional cities and states.  
- Explore causality between business density and housing market trends.  
- Incorporate other public datasets such as Census or Google Places data.
